# GTK Layer Shell

![GTK Layer Shell demo screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/dIuYcBM.png)

A library to write [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) applications that use [Layer Shell](https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml). Layer Shell is a Wayland protocol for desktop shell components, such as panels, notifications and wallpapers. You can use it to anchor your windows to a corner or edge of the output, or stretch them across the entire output. This library will not work on X11, or Wayland compositors that do not support wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1 (NOTE: Gnome does __not__ support Layer Shell). It supports all Layer Shell features including popups and popovers (GTK popups Just Workâ„¢). Please open issues for any bugs you come across.

- [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/focal/gtk-layer-shell) (>=20.04)
- [Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gtk-layer-shell) (>=31)
- [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/gtk-layer-shell/)
- [Gentoo](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/gui-libs/gtk-layer-shell)
- [Alpine](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/x86/gtk-layer-shell)
- [SUSE](https://packagehub.suse.com/packages/gtk-layer-shell/)

## Building from source
1. Clone this repo
2. Install build dependencies (see below)
3. `$ meson build -Dexamples=true -Ddocs=true`
4. `$ ninja -C build`
5. `$ sudo ninja -C build install`
6. `$ sudo ldconfig`

### Build dependencies
* [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) (>=0.45.1)
* [libwayland](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland) (>=1.10.0)
* [GTK3](https://www.gtk.org/) (>=3.22.0)
* [GObject introspection](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gobject-introspection/)
* [GTK Doc](https://www.gtk.org/gtk-doc/) (Optional)

To install these dependencies on Ubuntu 18.04 and later:
```
sudo apt install meson libwayland-dev libgtk-3-dev gobject-introspection libgirepository1.0-dev gtk-doc-tools
```

### Meson options
* `-Dexamples`: If to build gtk-layer-example and if to build and install gtk-layer-demo (default false)
* `-Ddocs`: If to generate the docs (default false)

## Using the library
* `gtk-layer-demo` is installed if examples are enabled. Its UI exposes all features of the library, and it's useful for testing layer shell support in compositors
* [gtk-layer-shell.h](include/gtk-layer-shell.h) shows the full API
* [example/example.c](example/example.c) is a minimal working app
* [demo/](demo/) contains the code for `gtk-layer-demo` (a more complex app)
* The easiest way to build is to use the `gtk-layer-shell-0` pkg-config package. Refer to your build system or the pkg-config docs for further instructions

## Licensing
GTK Layer Shell is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0 or any later version.

__By contributing to this project, you agree for your modifications to be licensed under the same license as the files they are made to (which may be a permissive license)__

### Licensing rationale
I want everyone to be able to use GTK Layer Shell however they desire, but parts of it are extracted from GTK. Therefore, the project as a whole is licensed under [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) or any later version (a newer version of the same license as GTK). See [LICENSE_LGPL.txt](LICENSE_LGPL.txt) and [LICENSE_GPL.txt](LICENSE_GPL.txt) for details. Almost all of the non-generated code, however, is licensed under [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) ([LICENSE_MIT.txt](LICENSE_MIT.txt)). At the top of each file should be a header that specifies which license applies to it. Please refer to that if in doubt.

### What this means for you
This library can be linked against under similar terms as GTK itself, so licensing shouldn't be a problem for most potential users. Furthermore, most of the code within this library can be used in permissively licensed or proprietary projects.
