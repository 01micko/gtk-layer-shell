# GTK compatibility
Due to limitations of GTK, GTK Layer Shell depends on unstable GTK internals. Each release works with all known versions of GTK (>=3.22.0) at the time of release, but future GTK updates may break them.

The table below shows which GTK Layer Shell versions work with which GTK versions. If GTK is between the last explicitly supported version and the last version known to work, the warning that likely sent you to this page is harmless. If there is a mistake, missing info or you have any other questions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/wmww/gtk-layer-shell/issues).

| GTK Layer Shell Version | Last explicitly supported GTK version | Last GTK version known to work | First GTK version known to crash |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1.0 | TODO | TODO | None |
| v0.2.0 | TODO | TODO | None |
| v0.3.0 | TODO | TODO | None |
| master | TODO | TODO | None |
