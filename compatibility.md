# GTK compatibility
Due to limitations of GTK, GTK Layer Shell depends on unstable GTK internals. Each release works with all versions of GTK >=3.22.0 at the time of release, but future GTK updates may occasionally break them. See [gtk-priv/README.md](gtk-priv/README.md) for more details.

The table below shows which GTK Layer Shell versions work with which GTK versions. If there is a mistake, missing info or you have any other questions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/wmww/gtk-layer-shell/issues).
